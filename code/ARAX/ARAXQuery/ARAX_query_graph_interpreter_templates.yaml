# Node templates should have one of the following formats:
#   n00()                     - a node with no curie or type specified
#   n00(type)                 - a node with only a type of any kind specified
#   n00(type=protein)         - a node with a specific type (such as a protein) specified
#   n00(curie)                - a node with a specific curie specified
#   n00(curie,type=protein)   - a node with a specific curie of the specified type.

  #### One node questions
  one_node_with_curie:
    name: One node what is question
    restated_question: What is n00(name)?
    description: A single node question, where the one node has a curie
    template:
      - n00(curie)
    DSL:
      - expand(node_id=n00)
      - resultify()

  one_node_with_type:
    name: One node with only a type
    description: A single node that has no curie but has a type. This could easily generate thousands of things.
    restated_question: Which n00(type)s are known?
    template:
      - n00(type)
    error: The input QueryGraph would just lead to thousands of nodes with this type. Not currently supported.

  one_node_with_no_type:
    name: One node with not even a type
    description: A single node that has no curie and no type. This is like tell me everything
    restated_question: Which biological entities are known?
    template:
      - n00()
    error: The input QueryGraph would yield all nodes in our knowledge graph. Not currently supported.
