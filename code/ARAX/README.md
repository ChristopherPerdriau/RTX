# Code for the ARAX Pilot software 

This directory contains the core software for the **ARAX** system for
computationally-assisted biomedical knowledge exploration that was built (on top
of our RTX reasoning tool system) by **Team ARA Expand** within the NCATS
Biomedical Data Translator program. For a high-level description of ARAX, ARA
Expand, and the Translator program, please see the
[main RTX repository page](../../../../tree/demo).
