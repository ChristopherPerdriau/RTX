### Natural language processing code
The code in here consists of a syntactic parser (span parser, obtained from [https://github.com/jhcross/span-parser](https://github.com/jhcross/span-parser)) and a semantic parser (TISP, obtained from [https://github.com/kaayy/TISP](https://github.com/kaayy/TISP)). Both are credited to [Liang Huang](https://github.com/lianghuang3) and students.
