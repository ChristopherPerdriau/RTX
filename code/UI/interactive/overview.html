<H1>Summary</H1>
<P>The ARAX Expander team presents a pilot Reasoning Tool for evaluation by NCATS. The pilot user interface (UI) consists of two parts, 1) a full web services interface supporting the 0.9.3 Translator Standard Reasoner API, and 2) a light Javascript-based GUI to make testing and visualization of results easier. The GUI is simply a thin client for the documented back end. All functionality is easily available from any remote tool that uses the API.</P>

<H1>Web Services Interface</H1>
<P>The web services interface expects and returns a JSON object as defined by the OpenAPI (Swagger) based Translator Standard Reasoner API definition. Both the API framework code, Python classes, and the <a target="_blank" href="api/rtx/v1/ui/">documentation for this interface</a> are autogenerated using OpenAPI tools and can be tested interactively.</P>

<H1>Interactive Interface</H1>
<P>The <a target="_blank" href="index.html">interactive interface is a simple Javascript-enhanced web page</a> with an input boxes to define queries and a results section. A few example questions are provided on the page to simplify testing. There are three different ways to present queries to ARAX: 1) the original RTX canned-question mechanism whereby an English question is parsed and matched to one of the template questions and then answered if possible; 2) A query graph-based mechanism by which an interactive tool helps the user build a query graph, which is send to the server for answering, and 3) A powerful domain specific language (DSL) mechanism called ARAXi that allows power users direct access to all ARAX modular components individually or in series to create new or operate on existing Translator Messages. Response Messages are stored on the server and can be easily recalled via their URI.</P>

<H1>The <b>translate</b> method</H1>
<P>The <a target="_blank" href="api/rtx/v1/ui/#!/translate/translate"><b>translate</b> method</a> accepts a posed natural language question and tries to translate that question into a predefined query type along with a set of terms that are needed for the query type. If the question cannot be understood, the web service returns <i>"Sorry, your question could not be interpreted"</i>. If the question appears to be successfully interpreted, the query type is returned as well as a restatement of the question that will be answered. The user should verify that the restated question, which is what will be answered, accurately reflects their intent. The few supported question types are interpreted via a rudimentary natural language processing package to allow for variable phrasing of the supported question types.</P>

<H1>The <b>query</b> method</H1>
<P>The <a target="_blank" href="api/rtx/v1/ui/#!/query/query"><b>query</b> method</a> accepts a known specific query type (<i>e.g., Which proteins does XXXXX target? (where XXXXX is drug)</i>), as well as the terms needed by the query type, or a pre-formed query graph, or a set of DSL commands, to try to answer the request using the ARAX knowledge graph and other knowledge providers. The results are always returned in NCATS Translator Reasoning Standard API Message format.</P>
