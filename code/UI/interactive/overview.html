<H1>Summary</H1>
<P>The RTX team presents a pilot Reasoning Tool for evaluation by NCATS. The pilot user interface (UI) consists of two parts, an interactive interface and a web services interface. The interactive interface simply uses the web service as its back end.</P>

<H1>Interactive Interface</H1>
<P>The <a target="_blank" href="index.html">interactive interface is a simple web page</a> with an input text box and a results section. A few example questions are provided on the page to simplify testing. When a question is typed into the input text box, an AJAX call is made to the <b>translate</b> method, which attempts to translate the free-text question into a previously defined query type and a list of key terms. This query type and terms are then passed to the <b>query</b> method via a JSON object sent via AJAX with POST to the web service, which attempts to compute an answer to the posed question. The results are returned as a JSON object and displayed to the user.</P>

<H1>Web Services Interface</H1>
<P>The web services interface expects and returns a JSON object as defined by the OpenAPI (Swagger) approach. Both the API code and the <a target="_blank" href="api/rtx/v1/ui/">documentation for this interface</a> are autogenerated using OpenAPI tools and can be tested interactively.</P>

<H1>The <b>translate</b> method</H1>
<P>The <a target="_blank" href="api/rtx/v1/ui/#!/translate/translate"><b>translate</b> method</a> accepts a posed natural language question and specified language (currently only English is supported) and tries to translate that question into a predefined query type along with a set of terms that are needed for the query type. If the question cannot be understood, the web service returns <i>"Sorry, your question could not be interpreted"</i>. If the question appears to be successfully interpreted, the query type is returned as well as a restatement of the question that will be answered. The user should verify that the restated question, which is what will be answered, accurately reflects their intent. The few supported question types are interpreted via a rudimentary natural language processing package to allow for variable phrasing of the supported question types.</P>

<H1>The <b>query</b> method</H1>
<P>The <a target="_blank" href="api/rtx/v1/ui/#!/query/query"><b>query</b> method</a> accepts a known specific query type (<i>e.g., Which proteins does XXXXX target? (where XXXXX is drug)</i>), as well as the terms needed by the query type, and tries to answer the query using the RTX knowledge graph. The results are currently returned mostly as free text, but a more extensive response will be developed in the next 10-month phase and inserted into this method. For the pilot phase, only a few question types (although many different drugs and diseases can be placed within the question types) are supported, including the 2 question types posed in the NCATS Translator Reasoning Tool FOA.</P>
