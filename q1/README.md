# Q1 as stated by NCATS in the Concept Letter FOA:

> 1. Genetic condition protects from a disease Sometimes a condition that causes
> adverse health effects also helps protect against other diseases. For example,
> the sickle cell trait offers some protection against malaria infection â€“
> heterozygous carriers of the sickle cell trait have a slight survival advantage
> in published studies.

> For each of the diseases listed below, list which other genetic conditions
> observed in the human population might offer protection AND WHY. Please also
> provide a confidence for each assertion.  For each of the diseases listed below,
